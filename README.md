The turtle is an arcade maze game that was created in the company of Gremlin Industries and published by Sega in the month of October 1976. It is considered an excellent game and has been gaining popularity with the public for many generations.The goal of playing the game is to predict the winner before the actual turtle race.

For beginners in Python and those seeking to create something simpler in their field can test this program. The module called Turtle was specifically designed to be used for beginners to play with and submit a program of the project. This project is written using Python 3.0.

Therefore, we will create a game that is based on Python with these modules.

Turtle: This is an installed Python library that allows users to draw patterns and images by providing the user with a virtual canvas.
Time: It is used in order to calculate the number of seconds since the date of the event.
Random: This is a function utilized to create random numbers in Python through the use of the random module.

<h2>Implementation:</h2>

Here is the step-by-step method to make the Snake Game using the Turtle module:

Step 1. Adding modules to the program and then giving an initial value for each game.

Step 2: We will create the display of this game, where the turtle reaches the end.

Step 3: We'll verify the key that turtle who won the race matches with the one predicted by the user or not.

Step 4: We will design the game in which the following things will be occurring:

The Turtle's body will move randomly.
When the fruit has been eaten, The score will then be recorded.
Examining the turtle's head reaching to the end.
The game will automatically stop immediately following the end.
Hence showing you the results if the game was successful and if your winner prediction matched with the actual winner of the game.
